# Table 1
![Table 1L](/assets/jama_331_13_1104_1.png)
Obviously a % cannot be exceed 100, so 172% is clearly incorrect. For the PVI
group in the right column, *n*=206 and thus 172/206&asymp;83 with rounding.
The number and percent are inverted and should read 172 (83) instead.

# Table 1 (continued)

Since the columns add to *n*=400 and *n*=205, they should correspond to the
values used for the **NYHA classification** totals. 106/400=26.5, so **II** for
**LAA ligation plus PVI** should be 106 (27) since half values round up. I'd
say 26.5 is much more accurate that 26 or 27. 106/404&asymp;0.2624 and so
perhaps we're using *n*=404? The table would be misleading then.

For **No history of heart failure** the same problem arises. 204/400=0.51 and
204/404&asymp;0.50495, so it should be 51% according to the column having a sum
of 400 and the header to the sub-table also stating *n*=400.

For **I** in the **PVI** group, 38/205&asymp;0.1854, so it should be 19% when
rounding to a whole integer. Note that 38/206&asymp;0.1845, so 18% would
correspond to *n*=206 being used. Again, this is misleading.

Finally, the **No history of heart failure** for the **PVI** group is also
incorrect, as 104/205&asymp;0.5073, which round to 51%. Using *n*=206 however
would round to 50%. It seems the table was using the original denominators and
not the values suggested in the **NYHA classification** sub-table.
