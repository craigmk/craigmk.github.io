# Table 1
![Table 1L](/assets/jama_331_13_1104_1.png)

Obviously a % cannot be exceed 100, so 172% is clearly incorrect. For the PVI
group in the right column, *n* = 206 and thus 172/206 &asymp; 83 with rounding.
The number and percent are inverted and should read 172 (83) instead.

# Table 1 (continued)

This table strikes me as misleading for several reasons.
1. The header for the **NYHA classification** clearly says *n* = 400 and *n* =
   205 for the sub-table, but it appears that the grand totals of *n* = 404 and
   *n* = 206 were used.
2. The sum for the two columns are indeed 400 and 205 respectively, so those
   should be the denominators.

For this reason, the table should read:

Variable                    | LAA ligation plus PVI | PVI
:---------------------------|:----------------------|--------:
I                           |  59 (15)              | 38 (19)
II                          | 106 (27)              | 45 (22)
III                         |  31 (8)               | 18 (9)
No history of heart failure | 204 (51)              | 104 (51)

Note that 106/400 = 0.265, so 26.5% could be rounded up or down according to
taste. This is a simple reason why rounding to whole integers is a bad idea.
I'd argue 26.5% is much more accurate than 26% or 27%. I rounded up in the
table above since I've always rounded half values up. It is 0.5% off regardless
of rounding down or up.
