Two mistakes in Table 4 of the Lancet, volume 403, page 1560, by Kulkami et al.
28/29 &asymp; 0.965517, thus **96.6%** is the correct value. Note that 14/15 is
repeated in both columns, however it is reported as 93.0% and then 93.3%. This
is a pretty easy catch, as both columns should be **93.3%** as reported in the
Sii-PTCV column.
