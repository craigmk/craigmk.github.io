Article by the ASOS-Paeds Investigators from the Lancet, volume 403, from April
13, 2024 has numerous errors and inconsistencies.

First, an in-text error on page 1485  that is certainly not 92.0% as reported.
240/249 &asymp; 0.8219, thus **82.2%** should be stated. I'd chalk this up to a
typo of 8 instead of 9 in print, however the .2 and .0 do not correspond.

Table 1 also has some variations. Either percentages should all be reported as
<1.0% or the actual percentage. Reporting 1.0% is misleading, especially if it
is not denoted anywhere that this was intentional. 47/6969 &asymp; 0.0067,
which should be **0.7%** for the "4 and 5" row. Note that all of the
highlighted items of 1.0% are not, however again this might've been
intentional, but there are also values for continued Table 1 on pg 1487 that
denote <1.0% and also have the correct percent for some that are less that 1
percent. Very inconsistent for the same table.

Unrelated to the 1% errors within Table 1, 599/1532 &asymp; 0.39099, so
**39.1%** for "Major" grade of surgery. Also on page 1486, 11/1531 &asymp;
0.007185, so while this might also be less than 1%, it is definitely not 3.4%.

Moving to page 1487, 1204/1532 &asymp; 0.7859, so "None" for comorbidity should
be **78.6%** instead of 66.8% as printed. 23/199 &asymp; 0.115578, so **11.6%**
is the correct value for "Non-specified physician" instead of 1.6%, which is
likely just a typo with a missed 1. Finally, 7166/8625 &asymp; 0.83084, so
**83.1%** for "Ward" instead of 83.9% as reported.

For Table 2 on page 1488, the same 1% error is again repeated. Quite a lack of
consistency in how these values are reported. The "Mortality" row should be
**0.6%** or at least, **<1.0%** as used in other cells from Table 1.
