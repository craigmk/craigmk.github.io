JAMA 331(14) page 1191, by Nielsen et al. from April 9, 2024 has a single error
in Table 2 for Myocardial ischemia. 2/362 &asymp; 0.005525, which should be
**0.6%** instead of 0.5% as reported. While 0.0055 could be rounded to either
0.005 or 0.006, the proportion does go beyond 0.0055 and should thus be rounded
up.
